Multi-View Adversarial Images with a Universal Perturbation

This paper proposes a novel universal perturbation method that, despite operating on 2D images, achieves a 3D-like attack capability by generating adversarial examples robust to variations in viewing angle, offering a more practical and scalable alternative to 3D adversarial attacks. This generalizable approach provides multi-view adversarial attacks while keeping the computational efficiency and practical aspects of single-view methods.

The paper is being submitted. The code will be released after the reviews.
